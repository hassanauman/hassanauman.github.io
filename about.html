            Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Hassan Nauman and I am a
            Software Engineer, specializing in Web Development. I have a passion
            for Coding, and I love creating beautiful, functional designs that
            help businesses and individuals achieve their goals.
            <br />
            <br />
            My journey in coding started when I was 14 Years and I realized that
            I had a talent for Programming. I studied Computer Science at Bahria
            College Karachi, and have since gained extensive experience working
            with clients across various industries. From small startups to large
            corporations, I have helped businesses of all sizes build their
            brands, increase their online presence, and improve their user
            experience.
            <br />
            <br />
            I believe that good design is not just about making things look
            pretty, but also about solving problems and creating value for
            users. That's why I approach every project with a focus on
            understanding my clients' needs and goals, and creating solutions
            that are tailored to their unique requirements.
            <br />
            <br />
            When I'm not working on client projects, you can find me playing
            sports and games, or attending design conferences and events to stay
            up-to-date on the latest trends and techniques in my field.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to the
            opportunity to work with you on your next project!
